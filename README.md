# Real Time KMeans clustering from scratch using numpy only

What this delivers (matches assignment)
Complete Python code – modular, commented, NumPy-based K-Means algorithm (initialization, assignment, centroid recalculation, empty-cluster handling).
Text-based WCSS output – printed to console and saved kmeans_outputs/wcss_values.txt.
Elbow plot – saved to kmeans_outputs/elbow_plot.png. Inspect it and interpret the elbow to pick K. (I used the known true K=4 in the script for the final run.)
Final clustering visualization – saved to kmeans_outputs/final_clusters_K4.png.
Textual analysis – saved to kmeans_outputs/analysis.txt (includes WCSS table, chosen K, purity and a short interpretation about convergence and cluster quality).
Ground-truth scatter also saved so you can visually compare.
